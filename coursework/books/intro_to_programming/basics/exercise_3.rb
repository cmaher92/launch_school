# Write a program that uses a hash to store a list of movie titles with the year they came out. Then use the `puts` command to make your program print out the year of each movie on the screen.

movies_hash = {:movie_1 => 1975, :movie_2 => 2004, :movie_3 => 2013, :movie_4 => 2001, :movie_5 => 1981}

puts movies_hash[:movie_1]
puts movies_hash[:movie_2]
puts movies_hash[:movie_3]
puts movies_hash[:movie_4]
puts movies_hash[:movie_5]

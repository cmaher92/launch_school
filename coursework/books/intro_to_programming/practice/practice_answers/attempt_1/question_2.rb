# Question 2

# I chose the until loop here because it's the easiest to read, very clear that the loop will continue to loop until the number is 0. Another option that can be used is the while loop, but it is less easier to read quickly.

number = 100

until number == 0
  puts number
  number -= 1
end

puts 'done looping'

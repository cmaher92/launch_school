# Write a method that will take a short line of text, and print it within a box.
#
# Example:
#
# print_in_box('To boldly go where no one has gone before.')

# | To boldly go where no one has gone before. |
# |                                            |

# print_in_box('')

# You may assume that the input will always fit in your terminal window.



# Solution
#
# def print_in_box(message)
#    horizontal_rule = "+#{'-' * (message.size + 2)}+"
#    empty_line = "|#{' ' * (message.size + 2)}|"
#
#    puts horizontal_rule
#    puts empty_line
#    puts "| #{message} |"
#    puts empty_line
#    puts horizontal_rule
# end
# Discussion
#
# This is a fairly straight forward solution To simplify matters, we start out by setting horizontal_rule and empty_line to appropriate values for the top and bottom 2 lines of the box. The expression '-' * (message.size + 2) simply creates a string of message.size + 2 hyphens; combined with the + at the beginning and end of the the string, this is just wide enough to draw the horizontal lines while leaving room for one blank on either side of the message.
#
# Further Exploration
#
# Modify this method so it will truncate the message if it will be too wide to fit inside a standard terminal window (80 columns, including the sides of the box). For a real challenge, try word wrapping very long messages so they appear on multiple lines, but still within a box.

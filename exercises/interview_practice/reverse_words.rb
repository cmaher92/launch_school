# You're working on a secret team solving coding transmissions

# Your team is scrambling to decipher a recent message,
# worried it's a plot to break into a major European
# National Bank Vault. The message has been mostly deciphered,
# but all the words are backward! Your colleagues have handed off the
# last step to you.

# Write a reverse_words!() method that takes a message as a string
# and reversed the order of the words in place. You cannot use the 
# split method, or the reverse method.

# input:
#   - String- message with all the words backwards
# output:
#   - Stringâ€“ reversed order of words
# constraints:
#   - you cannot use split or reverse method
# test input/output
#   -
# algorithm/data structure:
#   - reverse the order of the characters
#     - set two variables as begin, end set to 0 and the length of the message - 1
#     - while begin is less than end (loop)
#       - swap characters
#       - increment begin, decremement end
#   - reverse the order of the characters within the word
#     - find each word
#       - keep track of begin_word_index
#       - iterate until current character is a space or is the last character of the sentence
#       - if space
#         - call reverse_string! with message(begin_index, end_index-1)
#         - begin_index = end_index + 1
#         - end_index   = begin_index
#       - if last letter of string
#         - call reverse_string
#         - break

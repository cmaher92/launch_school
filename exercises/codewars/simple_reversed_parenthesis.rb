# Simple reversed parenthesis

=begin
Given a string, return the minimal number of parenthesis reversals needed to make balanced parenthesis.

For example:

solve(")(") = 2 Because we need to reverse ")" to "(" and "(" to ")". These are 2 reversals. 
solve("(((())") = 1 We need to reverse just one "(" parenthesis to make it balanced.
solve("(((") = -1 Not possible to form balanced parenthesis. Return -1.
Parenthesis will be either "(" or ")".

More examples in the test cases.

Good luck.

# input:
#   - String
# output:
#   - Intgerâ€“ minimal number of parenthesis reversals needed to make balanced parenthesis
# rules/constraints:
#   - return -1 if impossible
#   - if not even number of parenthesis, return -1
#   - reversal is when you switch a '(' to a ')' or ')' to a '('
# test input/output
#   -
# algorithm/data structure:
#   - return -1 if length is odd
#   - iterate over parenthesis
#   - set o, c and t to 0
#   - if '(' +1 to o
#   - if ')' +1 to c
#   - if c > 0
#     - -1 to c
#     - +1 to o
#     - +1 to t
#   - find difference between open and closed
#     - subtract closed from open
#   - divide difference by 2 and add to t
